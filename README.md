This project was originally developed under the `drogue-iot` organization. It has since been
transferred to [embassy-rs](https://github.com/embassy-rs), which now maintains it.

Embedded-TLS is a Rust-native TLS 1.3 implementation that works in a no-std environment. The Rust crate was formerly known as `drogue-tls`. The
implementation is work in progress, but the [example clients](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embedded-tls/tree/main/examples) should work against the [rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls) echo server.

The client supports both async and blocking modes. By default, the `std` feature is enabled, but can be disabled for bare metal usage.

To use the async mode, import `embedded_tls::*`. To use the blocking mode, import `embedded_tls::blocking::*`.

Some features and extensions are not yet implemented, have a look at [open issues](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embedded-tls/issues).

Only supports writing/receiving one frame at a time, hence using a frame buffer larger than 16k is not currently needed.  You may use a lower frame buffer size, but there is no guarantee that it will be able to parse any TLS 1.3 frame.
